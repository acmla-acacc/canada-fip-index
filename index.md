# Ontario Historical Fire Insurance Plan Index

***This project is in its early stages. Please consider all information as subject to change upon review***


The purpose of this website and the larger project is to provide a geospatial index to historical Fire Insurance Plans (FIPs) across Canada. The source of the information presented here is **Catalogue of Canadian fire insurance plans, 1875-1975, by Lorraine Dubreuil, Cheryl A. Woods. Ottawa: Association of Canadian Map Libraries and Archives, 2002.**.

More information on the project and the process can be found in the project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/acmla-acacc/canada-fip-index).
